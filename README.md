# Rotating Arrow Custom Symbol

**Version:** 1.0.4

## Overview
The sample code contained in this repository provides code to extend PI Vision with a new custom symbol.  
The custom symbol is an arrow that rotates 360 degrees based on the data item selected from the search pane.  Note, you can multi-state this symbol to change the color based on the same data item or a different data item.
This sample code includes the implementation, presentation, and configuration sections for a complete functioning custom symbol.
This sample assumes that you have familiarity with HTML/CSS/JavaScript. All files associated with a custom symbol are placed in the _ext_ folder under _INSTALLATION_FOLDER\Scripts\app\editor\symbols_. Please see the document _PI Vision 2019 Extensibility Guide_ for reference information on creating a custom PI Vision symbol on the AVEVA customer portal.
